Performed comprehensive sentiment and emotion analysis on mental health survey data to understand emotional patterns across different demographic groups, including age, stress level, and occupation. Leveraged VADER sentiment analysis and the NRC Emotion Lexicon to quantify emotional polarity and classify dominant emotions expressed in survey responses.

 

Developed clear and informative visual reports to highlight trends in mental health concerns, sentiment distribution, and emotion intensity across demographic segments. The analysis enabled comparative insights into how emotional states vary among different population groups, supporting data-driven interpretation of mental health patterns and potential intervention areas.
